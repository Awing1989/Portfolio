For this project I am querying a dataset about movies and TV shows.

1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT (title)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie';

2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
GROUP BY date_added
ORDER BY date_added asc;

3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
GROUP BY title
ORDER BY title asc;

4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT title.title, people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
on title.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE title.title='Bright Star';

5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT *
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
Limit(1);
