A. High Level Sales Analysis
1.  What was the total quantity sold for all products?
SELECT product_name, SUM(qty)
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
FULL JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
ON s.prod_id=pd.product_id
GROUP BY product_name

2.  What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
SELECT SUM(qty*price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales

3.  What was the total discount amount for all products?
SELECT SUM(qty*price*discount) AS Total_Revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales

B. Transaction Analysis
1.  How many unique transactions were there?
SELECT COUNT(distinct txn_id)
FROM balanced_tree.sales

2.  What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
WITH sub AS 

(SELECT s.txn_id, COUNT(distinct product_id) AS Unique_Product
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
FULL OUTER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
ON s.prod_id=pd.product_id
GROUP BY s.txn_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(sub.Unique_Product)) AS Answer
FROM sub

3.  What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
WITH sub AS 
(SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty*price*discount*.01) AS revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(revenue), 2)
FROM sub

4.  What is the average discount value per transaction?
WITH sub AS (SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty*price*discount) AS revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id)

SELECT ROUND(0.01*AVG(revenue), 2)
FROM sub

5.  What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
WITH sub AS 

(SELECT member, COUNT(distinct txn_id) AS txn_count
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY member)

SELECT member, txn_count, ROUND (100.0*txn_count/SUM(txn_count) OVER (), 2)
FROM sub

6.  What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
