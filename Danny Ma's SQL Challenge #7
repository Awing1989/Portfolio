A. High Level Sales Analysis

1.  What was the total quantity sold for all products?
SELECT pd.product_name, SUM(qty) AS Total_Sold
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
FULL OUTER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
ON s.prod_id=pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
ORDER BY pd.product_name;

2.  What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
SELECT SUM(qty*s.price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s;

3.  What was the total discount amount for all products?
SELECT SUM(qty*price*discount*0.01)
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE discount != 0;

B. Transaction Analysis
1.  How many unique transactions were there?
SELECT COUNT(distinct txn_id)
FROM balanced_tree.sales

2.  What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
WITH sub AS (SELECT COUNT(distinct prod_id) AS avg_uniq_prod, txn_id
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
FULL OUTER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
ON s.prod_id=pd.product_id
GROUP BY txn_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_uniq_prod)) AS answer
FROM sub;

3.  What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

4.  What is the average discount value per transaction?
WITH sub AS 

(SELECT SUM(qty*price*discount) AS discount, txn_id
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(discount)*0.01, 2) AS avg_discount
FROM sub;

5.  What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
